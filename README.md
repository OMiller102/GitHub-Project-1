### _Miller-Lab Assignment 3_
  In this lab assignment our task was to create a canvas that incorperated several different types of functions to help us understand how the code works.
  these functions ranged from **Background**, **ColorMode**, **Varibles**, **FrameRate()**, **mouseX/Y and pmouseX/Y**, as well as some triganometry functions such as **pow()**, **sqrt()**, **abs()**.

### _Miller-Lab Assignment 4_
  In this lab assignment our task was to use and learn about Movement, Mouse, and Conditional Logic. Our goal with using the funcitons of for this assignment was to create a canvas that featured movement or some form of animation in it. Some of the code that we used for this assignment was **mouseClicked()**, **mousePressed()**, and **keyIsPressed()**; we also began to use **if else statements** as well as **for while loops**.

### _Miller-Lab Assignment 5_
  For this assignment the main objective was to learn about Creative Interactivity / Design buttons with mouse and keyboard. Our goal for this assignment was to create a composition on the canvas that resembled a theme of either a television or a desktop computer. To do this we used some of the previous functions that we have used in the other lab assignments such as **ellipseMode()**, **mouseClicked()**, **mousePressed()**, **mouseX/Y**, **keyIsPressed()**, and **if else statements**.
